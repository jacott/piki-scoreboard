      <h1>General Information</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Piki is a results-management system for <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org">IFSC</a>-format climbing competitions. Piki allows some customization for organizations who wish to modify the <b>competition format</b>: administrators can designate the number of rounds in the competition, the quota of competitors for each round, and the number of boulders for each round in a Boulder competition. Piki's <b>scoring system</b> follows the IFSC rules and is not customizable.</li>
        <li>Piki is in <b>beta</b> indefinitely:
          <ul>
            <li>New features are being added which may change the way Piki works.</li>
            <li>You can expect defects and issues to arise as you use the system in real events.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Piki is developed and tested only for use with the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> web browser. Piki may or may not work with other web browsers.</li>
        <li>The developers intend to release Piki under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero General Public Licence</a> in 2015, making the system available at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
