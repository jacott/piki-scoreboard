      <h1>General Information</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Piki is in beta indefinitely:
          <ul>
            <li>New features are being added which may change the way parts of the system are used.</li>
            <li>Users can expect defects and issues to arise as the system is used in real events.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Piki is developed and tested only for use with the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome web browser</a>. Piki may or may not work with other web browsers.</li>
        <li>Piki is currently available as a web application, requiring hosting.</li>
        <li>It is the developers' intention to release Piki under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero General Public Licence</a> in 2015, making the system available at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
        <li>Piki is designed for use managing results in climbing competitions run according to the <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org">IFSC</a> rules. There is some flexibility, such as the ability to set the quota of competitors for each round after the qualification round, and the ability to set the number of boulders for each round in a Boulder competition. But Piki is unlikely to meet the requirements of competitions using scoring systems different to that set out in the IFSC rules.</li>

      <h1>View and print start lists, results and other event details</h1>
      <p>
        A login is not required to view and print details of an Organization’s events, including results and start lists.
      </p>
      <p>To go to the <i>Results</i> or <i>Start lists</i> page for a particular event:
        <ul>
          <li>If you are on a page relating to the event, click <i>Results</i> or <i>Start lists</i> in the main menu.</li>
          <li>If the event name is displayed in the page header, click that, then click <i>Results</i> or <i>Start lists</i> in the main menu.</li>
          <li>If neither of the above applies:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your Organization's Piki home page (by clicking your Organizations name at the top left of page), and click <i>Events</i> in the main menu.</li>
              <li>Click on the desired event in the list.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To print:
        <ul>
          <li>On the <i>Results</i> or <i>Start lists</i> page for an event, select categories to print.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> only categories consisting of the same number of qualification and final heats can be selected together; categories consisting of different numbers of qualification and final heats must be selected and printed separately.
          </li>
          <li>From the any page on Piki, including a start list or results page, use your browser's commands or menus to print.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Printed start lists are intended for use as <b>judges' forms</b>, for entering results by hand during climbing (those results then to be entered into Piki). The Bouldering start lists contain a wide column to the right of the competitors' names for entering results tallies by hand, so that judges who are judging more than one boulder may rule lines by hand to create multiple columns: one column for each boulder the judge is judging. Be sure to label each column with the boulder number, so that when the data is entered into Piki it can be entered for the correct boulder!
