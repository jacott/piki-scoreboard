      <ul>
        <li>Piki is a web application for managing the results
        of <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org">IFSC</a>-format climbing competitions. Piki
        allows some customization of the <i>competition format</i>: for Lead and Boulder
        competitions, Admins can designate the number of rounds in the competition, the quota of
        competitors for each round, and for boulder competitions the number of boulders for each
        round. Piki's <i>scoring system</i> follows the IFSC rules and is not customizable.</li>
        <li>Piki is in beta:
          <ul>
            <li>New features are being added which may change the way Piki works.</li>
            <li>Please expect defects and issues to arise as you use the system.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Piki is developed and tested only for use with
        the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> web
        browser. Piki may or may not work with other web browsers.</li>

        <li>Click <i>Categories</i> in the menu.</li>
        <li>Click <i>Add new category</i>.<br>
          Or, to edit an existing category, select the category from the list.<br>
          <b>Note:</b> editing an existing category will change that
          category only for new events. To edit a category for an
          event already created,
          <inlinehelp>
            go to the <i>Edit event</i> page<popup>{{> NavEditEvent}}</popup>

          for that event.<br>
          Instructions:<br>
          <ol>
            <li>Enter the <b>category name</b>, e.g. <i>Youth A Female Lead</i>.</li>

            <li>Enter the <b>category code</b> ("short name"),
              e.g. <i>FYAL</i>. If your organization will
              be <a href="#upload-registrations">uploading registrations
                from file</a> then the category code used here must be the
              same as the category code used in the upload file.</li>

            <li>Enter the <b>group</b> name, e.g. <i>Boulder Open</i>. Where individual climbers may
              compete in more than one category at an event, those categories must be allocated to
              separate groups. For example, if climbers may compete in a Lead category and a Boulder
              category, then you might choose to have two groups: <i>Lead</i> and <i>Boulder</i>. If
              some competitors are permitted to enter a Youth category and an Open category in both
              Lead and Boulder, then you might have four groups: <i>Youth Lead</i>, <i>Youth
                Boulder</i>, <i>Open Lead</i> and <i>Open Boulder</i>. Minimizing your organization's
              total number of groups keeps your <i>Registrations</i> page tidy, which aids fast and
              easy registration of competitors.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><tt><b><i>n</i>t<i>a n</i>b<i>a</i></b></tt> (<i>n</i> = the number of tops or bonus
              holds achieved; <i>a</i> = the number of attempts taken to achieve those tops or bonus
              holds;<br> e.g. 2t5 3b4 is a score indicating 2 tops achieved in 5 attempts and 3
              bonus holds achieved in 4 attempts)</li>
            <li><tt>0t <i>n</i>b<i>a</i></tt> (no tops achieved)</li>
            <li><tt>0t 0b</tt> (no tops or bonus holds achieved)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Speed scores</h1>
        <p>
          Valid scores:
          <ul>
            <li>a time in seconds, e.g. 9.876</li>
            <li><b>fall</b></li>
            <li><b>fs</b> (false start)</li>
            <li><b>wc</b> (wildcard; given to a competitor in a race in the Final Round whose
            opponent makes a false start)</li>
            <li><b>-</b> (did not race)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> if a competitor wins the final race (the race for 1st and 2nd) because their
          opponent makes a false start, that winning competitor is granted one attempt to try to
          break records. If that winning competitor makes a false start in their attempt to break
          records, Piki users should not enter a score of <i>fs</i> (false start) for that winning
          competitor (because that gives the appearance of a tie, and Piki will automatically apply
          tiebreak procedures). Instead, Piki users should enter a score of <i>wc</i> (wildcard) for
          the winning competitor.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reopening a stage</b></p>
        <p>
          Once the results for a stage have been correctly entered, click <i>Next</i> to close the
          stage and instruct Piki to build the next step of the event. In case a previous stage has
          to be reopened to correct an error in the scores entered, the Piki developers have created
          a <i>Reopen stage</i> feature. This feature is functional not fancy, and should be used
          with care:
          <ul>
            <li>Reopening a stage may automatically also reopen preceding stages. If the stage you
            reopen displays not as you expect, go to the <i>Qualifier</i> and close each stage in
            turn until the stage you want to edit.</li>
            <li>If the initial (incorrect) version of results for your reopened stage included
            additional attempts on Lane A to break a tie or ties, and your correction means those
            additional attempts are not required to break a tie, it is important to delete the
            scores for those additional attempts because they could affect Piki's calculations of
            rankings.</li>
            <li>Reopening a stage affects all following stages. After correcting the error and
            closing the stage you reopened, check the results in each following stage in turn.</li>
          </ul>
