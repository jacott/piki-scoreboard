How Piki interprets IFSC rule 11.7.2

Rule 11.7.2 on World Cup Ranking states that "the points gained by tied competitors in a competition will be the average of the points for the tied rank positions. The points will be rounded off to whole numbers."

The rules do not specify whether "rounded off" means rounded up, rounded down, or either rounded up or down depending on the size of the fractional part of the number.

Piki rounds down because of precedents found among the results on the IFSC website of rankings with a fractional part of .5 being rounded down, including:
2015 World Cup Boulder - Toronto
Jernej Kruder and Domen Skofic tied for 11th place; each awarded 29 points.

2015 World Cup Boulder - Chongqing
Four competitors tied for 27th place; each awarded 3 points.
